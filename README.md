A projected based on a user friendly social media page that allows users to edit the account credentials to their own, add photos, delete photos and even like the photots!

How the Project was created:

The project layout was made with HTML 5 and CSS with the idea of a very appealing, slick look. The edit form and the add form were both created and made interactive using OOP JavaScript. Each form has a smooth transition into opening and closing. The user can also close the forms using the escape key or by simply pressing anywhere on the screen while the form is open. Each form also has integrated form validation to ensure that the user is entering valid data. The validation was also implemented using OOP. The user can also like and delete cards from the stack seamlessly! Did I forget to mention that the website is also fully responsive?
